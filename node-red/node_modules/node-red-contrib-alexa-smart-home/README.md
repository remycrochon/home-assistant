# Features

- A wide variety of supported device types and capabilities/ traits (details below)
- Real-time state reporting in the Alexa and Google Home apps.
- Alexa _and_ Google Home support, you can choose to use either, or both (note Google Home integration is currently awaiting certification but you can request access)

To enable Google Home/ Google Assistant functionality follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/coldfire84/node-red-alexa-home-skill-v3-web/wiki/Use-the-Hosted-Instance#google-assistant).

# Getting Started

Using the (free to use) hosted instance you can be up and running in just a few minutes:

1. Setup an account [here](https://red.cb-net.co.uk).
2. Once logged in, create your devices [here](https://red.cb-net.co.uk/devices).
3. Install and configure these nodes to your Node-RED instance.
4. Build relevant flows, see examples [here](https://red.cb-net.co.uk/docs).

Alternatively, you can deploy your own instance of this service, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/coldfire84/node-red-alexa-home-skill-v3-web/wiki/Deploy-Your-Own).
